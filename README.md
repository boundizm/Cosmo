# Cosmo
The discord bot you dream of the whole time.

# 🎃 Introduction
Cosmo is a bot designed to provide you with not only entertaining and funny, but also helpful commands that ease up a lot of stuff. From downloading youtube videos directly onto your phone to having reddit media and memes delivered right to your favorite group chat without the hassle of sharing links, TiTAN has got you covered.

The bot is private, meaning its only available for whitelisted users. It'll most likely be available for a subscription soon, but the bot is in a early testing stage currently.

If you're excited and wish to help out, hit me up at aarivex.dev or Telegram (@canathan).
You can always suggest features or give feedback.

# 👻 Bug reports
If you've encountered a bug or error, we'd suggest you to use the Issues page to report any malfunction.

# Technical stuff
The bot is written in the beautiful C# language and built, ran and maintained on the lovely .NET Core 3 runtime. Our main focus is stability and a great user experience. ❤️

Commands marked with ``!`` are upcoming commands that are not available yet.  
``^`` indicates a command in beta with the given possibility of unstability.  

If a usage identifier has a ``[]`` (for example ``<tags[]>``), the argument supports more than one term, like ``/cmd tag1 tag2 tag3..``.  
Identifiers inside brackets ``(<something>)`` are optional arguments, making the command use its defaults if not specified.
